Dear Tarik,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide you with an update on the work I have been doing with the Excel sheet you shared with me.

I have carefully reviewed the sheet and collected as many resources as possible from it. For some of the code, I have already written scripts, but I am currently waiting for the exact specifications before launching them. For others, I have launched them and am continuing to explore the remaining resources.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. I look forward to discussing this further with you.
